<p>I am currently a graduate student in the Sociology Department at the University of Virginia. In addition to sociological studies, I have also completed a master’s degree in musicology at Tufts University, where I researched the connection between cultural values and the business practices of nonprofit music organizations. My current interests include cultural narratives, group identity, and scripts of justification and reasoning. I recently completed a master’s thesis which examined the available frameworks and scripts used by groups to make and justify contested claims. Specifically, my work considered the shared scripts used by three groups (a Native American Tribe, Ancient Astronaut Theorists, and the Daughters of the Revolution) to make claims about their ancestry and origins. Currently, I am exploring research possibilities for her dissertation. She hopes to expand her work on scripts of justification and reasoning to new empirical settings.</p>  

<p>In addition to research, I also participate in three other scholarly communities at UVa.  I am an associate fellow at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture, a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows, and a member of the Praxis team assocaited with UVa's Scholar's Lab.  Currently, I am also serving as the president of the Sociology Graduate Student Council. </p>
