    	<p>I am a sociologist currently working on a PhD at the University of Virginia. My current interests include cultural narratives, group identity, and scripts of justification and reasoning. I recently completed a master’s thesis which examined the available frameworks and scripts used by groups to make and justify contested claims. Specifically, my work considered the shared scripts used by three groups (a Native American Tribe, Ancient Astronaut Theorists, and the Daughters of the Revolution) to make claims about their ancestry and origins. Currently, I am exploring research possibilities for her dissertation. She hopes to expand her work on scripts of justification and reasoning to new empirical settings.  In addition to sociological studies, I have also completed a master’s degree in musicology at Tufts University, where I researched the connection between cultural values and the business practices of nonprofit music organizations. </p>
